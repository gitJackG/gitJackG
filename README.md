I'm a Computer Science graduate eager to begin my professional career. I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge in low level programming with C & C++. <br>
<br>
On the side I like to make personal/professional websites from the ground up with full ownership, using the MERN stack, hosted on Oracle Cloud and using NGINX as the web server.<br>
